## Graphics

### Sprites (terrain, trees, nature, camps, villages, people, clan symbols, animals)

| What | Source | Author | Rights |
|---|---|---|---|
| 32 sheets of 4×4 sprites in `art/sheets/` (A–L terrain, nature, settlements, people; M–Q animals; R secrets; S–V elders; W–Z growing trees; AA–AF stumps, work, night, storytellers, growing villages), cut into `art/cut/` and packed into `public/sprites/atlas*.png` | Generated with ChatGPT image generation (OpenAI), November 2026 | leppermesiah, with ChatGPT | Under OpenAI's terms of use, the rights to generated output belong to the user who generated it. Used by the project with his permission. |
| App icon: `public/icon-*.png`, `public/favicon-32.png`, `art/social-preview.png` | Generated with ChatGPT image generation (OpenAI), November 2026 | leppermesiah, with ChatGPT | As above |

Notes:
- The prompts do not name specific games, artists or protected characters; they only describe a style ("cozy painterly isometric pixel art").
- AI-generated content may not be protected by copyright in some countries, so nothing more than the above is claimed.
- Cutting, halo cleanup and atlas packing are done by the project's own scripts `tools/slice_sprites.py` and `tools/build_atlas.py`.

## Names and translations

Bulgarian personal names, nicknames, settlement roots and clan totems are common words and names, collected by hand in
`src/server/sim/names.ts`. The English translations and the transliteration (Bulgarian streamlined system) are in
`src/shared/i18n.ts`. Fairy tale heroes named by the secrets are public domain folk and literary characters.

## Inspiration

Ideas for the future (generation ships, terraforming, colonies) come from common themes of classic science fiction.
No plots, characters, names or texts are copied from specific books.
